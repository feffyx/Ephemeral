# 🌌 Ephemeral 

As the design team for the ARTE Program, we decided to develop a **VisionOS application** to showcase the limitless possibilities of design for **Apple Vision Pro**.

Immerse yourself in **space** and **explore** the planet, in a way that feels **natural, seamless, and intuitive**.

Built on the **UI principles** we’ve researched and refined.
